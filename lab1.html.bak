        <p style="color:#FF6347;">Welcome to my webpage! My name is Marcel, and I’m 21 years old. I consider myself a curious and driven individual. I currently play basketball for UWI, and in the future, I aspire to become a Database Manager, Software Architect, or Software Engineer.
Some quick facts about me:

My favorite color is red.

My favorite meal is cow liver with rice—simple but delicious!

My hobbies include working out, reading books and notes that expand my knowledge, and watching anime.</p>
